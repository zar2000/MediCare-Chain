# Medicare Chain
MediCare Chain is a decentralized application built on top of Ethereum that aims to provide a HealthCare Solution by ensuring a transaparent and reliable system of providing insurance as well as donations to the patients, with utmost efficiency and zero involvement of any third party.

## What exactly are the Hurdles in Health Care Sector?
Truth be told, the Health Care sector is one of those rare sectors where we can't afford any sort of chaos since in this sector we have lives at stake.

***That problem is the current paradigm of the medical insurance service and financial solutions for the patients.***

With the advancement of technology and medical science, and not every patient can afford the costly medical facilities.

**According to a *CarePayment Research Survey, it was quite clearly found that almost 64% of all the patients in America either avoids or delays any medical care because of the high cost*.**

**While 61% of them are the ones who can't even think of affording medical care.**

And this statistics remains same or even worse for many other underdeveloped countries.

***While the insurance and donations do help patients to get the best possible medical facility, there still lies an enormously large chain of Middlemen, central authorities as well as third parties at multiple levels in this procedure.***

Therefore, we need a system that eradicates these third parties and allow the patient to be in control of the complete insurance or donation amount so that they can avail better medical facilities.

## Solution By Medicare Chain
Medicare Chain address the issue of third parties and centralized authorities involved in the medical transactions in Health Care sector.

Its utmost priority is to enable the patients to get a complete control over their entire medical funds without loosing it to any third party. 

So that the patient can avail the health care facility that they deserve.

## 3 Main tools of Medicare Chain
* **Decentralization**: Eradicates any control of central authorities over the medical funds or donation amounts.
Thus, ensures utmost security from any tamper with medical data

* **Smart Contract**:  Handles all the transactions of the funds between different parties without third party interference. Thus ensures reliability and trust in the system.

* **Blockchain**: Stores every single detail of all transactions on the Blockchain and makes it immutable.

## Distribution of Power in Medicare Chain
Centralization of any kind reduces trust in a system. Therefore its imperative not put all the controls in one hand.

*Therefore Medicare Chain solves this issue with a very imperative feature, i.e.* **Distribution of POWER.**

There are 3 main actors in the system but none of them have access to all the functionalities of the system.
For example:

* **Admin** can add new patients to the Blockchain, but has no control over patient's funds.

* **Doctors** can withdraw funds(when necessary) , but cannot add or handle patient’s details.

* **Donors** can donate funds to only patients, but can neither handle or examine medical data of the patients.


## Functionalities of this DAPP

### Storing Data on Blockchain and IPFS

While adding a particular patient to the blockchain, the medical records and files are store on InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) and a hash of those files is attached with the patient's PID(patient's uniquely generated Identification Number).

### Doctor's Digital Signature
A Patient and his Medical Certificates are not approved unless a Doctor examines his patient's condition.

Once the Doctor has throughly cross-checked all the medical documents and is completely satisfied,he/she can digitally sign and approve the Patient's Condition. 

Once the doctor signs a Patient's condition, he/she will be incharge of that Patient thus gaining access to some functionalities like withdrawing funds from the Patient's Account when needed.

Doctor's digital sign on a Patient also makes it legit and  enables the patient to receive donations from all across the world.

## Restricting access to medical data
Medical data is crucial. It demands additional security.

**Medicare Chain solves this issue by allowing only those Doctor's address to access the medical.**

Most importantly, **not even the admin is allowed to access the medical records.**

*Thus ensuring **Distribution of Power.***

### Withdrawing Amount from Patient's Funds
This is one of the most imperative functionalities of this DAPP.
The funds are withdrawn from a Patient only when required for medical expanses.

In fact, the funds can only be withdrawn by the Doctor assigned to this Patient(By the Doctor who signed this Patient's Medical Condition). No one else can withdraw the funds unless rules are modified by the owner of the contract.

### Donating To Patients
This functionality of donating cryptocurrency to the patients is available for anyone with a Ethereum Account and some funds.

The amount donated by anyone on the network gets added to Donated Amount section of the Patient receiving the fund.

**NOTE**
### Donated Funds aren't Withdrawable
In order to simplify the supply of funds and make it manageable, **all the funds that the patient receive as donations(*not insurance funds*) are initially not withdrawable.**

**It requires the admin's approval to transfer funds from Donations to Insurance funds and only then those funds can be used.**
