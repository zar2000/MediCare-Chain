# Medicare Chain
MediCare Chain DAPP is a decentralized application built on top of Ethereum that aims to provide a HealthCare Solution by ensuring a transaparent and reliable system of providing insurance as well as donations to the patients, with utmost efficiency and zero involvement of any third party.

It maintains a proper ledger of donations received, funds withdrawn as well as insurance details and stores them on Blockchain, thus ensuring immutability and security from any tamper with the financial records.

This applications maintains an immutable record of patients along with their neccessary medical details and stores them on the Blockchan. Moreover, this application uses InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) to store any kind of Medical Certificates, X-rays or other Medical documents related to the Patient. 

## Functionalities of this DAPP

### Storing Data on Blockchain and IPFS

While adding a particular patient to the blockchain, the medical records and files are store on InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) and a hash of those files is attached with the patient's PID(patient's uniquely generated Identification Number).

### Doctor's Digital Signature
A Patient and his Medical Certificates are not approved unless a Doctor examines his patient's condition.
Once the Doctor has throughly cross-checked all the medical documents and is completely satisfied,he/she can digitally sign and approve the Patient's Condition. Once the doctor signs a Patient's condition, he/she will be incharge of that Patient thus gaining access to some functionalities like withdrawing funds from the Patient's Account when needed.

Doctor's digital sign on a Patient also makes it legit and  enables the patient to receive donations from all across the world.

##### Note: Only those public addresses that are assigned as Doctors by the Owner of the Smart Contract can sign and approve the patient's medical condition.

### Withdrawing Amount from Patient's Funds
This is one of the most imperative functionalities of this DAPP.
The funds are withdrawn from a Patient only when required for medical expanses.

In fact, the funds can only be withdrawn by the Doctor assigned to this Patient(By the Doctor who signed this Patient's Medical Condition). No one else can withdraw the funds unless rules are modified by the owner of the contract.
